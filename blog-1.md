The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union:

Basically union types giving us the way to hold multiple types together. sometimes we can't decide which type we should allocate for a variable or contant, at that period we can add multiple choices of types for that variable.

This gives us type flexibility and error reduction easily. but significantly more most important feature is type narrowing ,as typescript can narrow down the type.this helps us to specific type at the runtime based on the condition or operation.


Intersection:

as intersection combine multiple types into one.
meaning value have to satisfy all the types simultaneously.

this allows us structured data type and help us extend the functionality. as combining types help us to compose the complex types in a modular way, run time we get a very good amount of type safety.
